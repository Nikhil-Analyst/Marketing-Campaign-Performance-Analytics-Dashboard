# Project Overview

This project analyses marketing campaign performance using SQL and Power BI to identify key drivers of revenue, campaign efficiency, and potential optimization opportunities.

The raw dataset contained multiple campaign-level metrics such as spend, clicks, conversions, and revenue, which were cleaned and analysed using SQL. The processed data was then used to build an interactive Power BI dashboard to help stakeholders monitor marketing performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to transform raw marketing campaign data into actionable insights by:

1. Evaluating campaign performance and return on ad spend (ROAS)

2. Identifying high-performing and underperforming campaigns

3. Detecting funnel leakage where high clicks did not translate into conversions

4. Classifying campaigns into Scale, Watch, or Stop categories

5. Creating an interactive dashboard for decision-making

## Tools & Technologies Used:

SQL – Data cleaning, transformation, and analytical queries

Power BI – Data visualisation and dashboard creation

Excel / CSV – Data source

## Key Metrics Analysed

The project focused on analysing important marketing KPIs such as:

1. Marketing Spend

2. Clicks

3. Conversions

4. Revenue

5. Click-Through Rate (CTR)

6. Conversion Rate

7. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

## Analysis Performed
1. Campaign Performance Analysis:

Analysed campaign-level performance to determine which campaigns generated the highest revenue and return on investment.

2. Funnel Analysis:

Studied the marketing funnel from clicks to conversions to identify inefficiencies and campaigns with poor conversion performance.

3. Funnel Leak Identification:

Campaigns with high click volume but low conversion rates were flagged as potential funnel leaks requiring further optimisation.

4. Campaign Classification

Campaigns were categorised into three performance groups:

## Category	Criteria
Scale	ROAS ≥ 2 and Spend ≥ 50,000
Watch	ROAS between 1 and 2
Stop	ROAS < 1 and Spend ≥ 30,000

This classification helps marketing teams allocate budget more efficiently.

## Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard provides:

1. Campaign performance overview

2. Spend vs Revenue comparison

3. ROAS analysis

4. Funnel performance visualisation

5. Campaign classification (Scale / Watch / Stop)

6. Interactive filtering by campaign and channel

## Key Insights

1. A small number of campaigns contributed to the majority of total revenue, indicating strong performance concentration.

2. Several campaigns generated high traffic but low conversions, suggesting funnel inefficiencies.

3. Certain campaigns consumed significant marketing spend while producing low ROAS, highlighting opportunities for budget optimisation.

4. High-performing campaigns with strong ROAS could be scaled to increase overall marketing returns.
